Introduction
============

This book is for anyone who wants learn computer networking
through a series of hands-on projects.

This book will take you from low-level networking projects, such as
controlling the voltage on a wire to communicate
from one computer to another, to higher-level projects such
as writing a program to generate and serve images.

This is **not** a book that dives deep into networking
theory, skipping the implementation.

It is **not** a book that covers one narrow topic thoroughly,
like Cisco routers, or cabling.

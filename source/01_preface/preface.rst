Preface
=======

This book teaches computer networking by combining theory, tutorials, and
projects.

Why did I write this book?
Back when I was in college my networking class taught me a lot of *theory*.
When I finished that class I knew how to network computers *in theory*.
I'd never done it in reality. I felt that if I'd taken a class in networking,
I should have networked some computers by the end of it!
I told myself if I ever became a
professor I'd teach hands-on practical assignments.

Fast-forward through fifteen years of industry and graduate school,
that theory helped a lot more than my cynical younger self thought it would.
But that first "jump" to make theory into
reality was a rather large learning hurdle.

Eventually I changed jobs and started teaching college. I wanted to do better
with my classes.
But the books I found
never had the right mix of theory and hands-on projects.

So I wrote this. It covers the concepts that I needed
to know during my career as a programmer. Just as importantly,
the mini-projects let you see those concepts in action.

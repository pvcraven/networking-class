Preface
=======

This computer networking  book contains a mix of theory, and
projects.

Why did I write this book?
Back when I was in college my networking class taught me a lot of *theory*.
When I finished that class I knew how to network computers *in theory*.
I'd never done it in reality. I felt that if I'd taken a class in networking,
I should have networked some computers by the end of it!
I told myself if I ever became a
professor I'd teach hands-on practical assignments.

Fast-forward through fifteen years of industry and graduate school,
that theory helped a lot more than my cynical younger self thought it would.
But that first "jump" to make theory into
reality was a rather large learning hurdle.

Eventually I moved into teaching college. I wanted to do better
with my classes.
But the books I found
never had the right mix of theory and hands-on projects.

So I wrote my own. This book covers the parts of networking that I needed
to know during my career as a programmer. It has sample mini-projects so that you can
see the concepts in action.

Simpson College Networking Class
================================

This class is designed to give students an understanding
of computer networking from the low-level physical implementation
all the way up to writing applications that utilize networking.

The class covers theory. Then we use tutorials to learn how we
can apply that theory. Then we actually apply it. Grading is
based the last stage, the actual application.

Understanding UNIX Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(Easy)

* On the Raspberry Pi, or a Linux computer of some sort, explain "groups" and
  why we have them.
* `Here's a tutorial <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-user-administration.htm>`_.
* `Here's another <https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups>`_.
* Show how to:
    * Explain all the file permission indicators shown when you do a ``ls -la``
    * Create a user
    * Delete a user
    * Change a password
    * Create a group
    * Add a new person to a group
    * Add an existing person to a group
    * Remove a person from a group
* Understand the ``chmod``, ``chown``, ``useradd``, ``passwd``, ``groups``, ``userdel``, ``newgrp``, ``chgrp``, ``usermod`` commands.
* Learn the Chmod Octal Format
* Show me, in person, how this works.

SSH Using Public/Private Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(Easy)

* Figure out how to shell to another computer using SSH and a public/private key. Do this
  with two Linux/Mac computers using the ``.ssh`` directory.
* `Tutorial <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2>`_ (Steps 1-3)
* Make sure you know what directory and files all the key info is stored in. Ask if you
  have trouble figuring it out, because the directory is hidden.
* Explain the purpose of the ``id_rsa``, ``id_rsa.pub``, ``authorized_keys``, ``known_hosts``
  files.
* Demonstrate, in person, the ability to shell between computers this way.
* Note: You can leave the pass phrase blank, and then shell directly between computers
  simply based on having the key. If you include a pass phrase, then you need both the
  key and know the pass phrase. There is a trade-off between security and convenience.

Understanding Cookies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(Easy)

* Show and explain, in person, how this whole web-cookie thing works.
  If you can't figure it out on your
  own you can ask, but then you must wait 24 hours before you are allowed to
  explain it to me.
* Demonstrate and show what happens with a cookie to manage a session via Wireshark.
* **Note**: When you are looking at a web request in Wireshark, your can right-click
  on one of the packets and "Follow TCP Stream" to see the whole exchange in plain-text format.
* You can use this website:
    * `Source code of website <http://webdev.training/index.php?chapter=login_management>`_
    * `Website itself <http://webdev.training/chapters/login_management/v2/main.php>`_
    * The password is "mysecretpassword"
* How is a cookie set? What does across the wire?
* What is the difference between a persistent and a session cookie?
* What is a third party cookie?
* How do you set an expire time on a cookie? (See `cookie options <https://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/05/05/http-cookies-explained/>`_)
* What is a cookie path?
* Why would you not set a cookie to equal a user name?
* How does a cookie track a user name or other information? How does it hold
  "session data" when none of that is stored in the cookie?
* Session data for most languages is stored in memory.
    * What is the best data structure for doing this?
    * What are disadvantages of doing this?
    * When programming, what do you need to keep in mind because of this?
    * What are advantages/disadvantages of storing data in the database?
* What are the security risks around cookies?
  How `does this work <http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-5-device-can-hack-your-locked-computer-in-one-minute?utm_source=mbtwitter>`_ and
  how do you stop it?

Encryption Coding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(Hard)

* Use libraries in Java, Python, or whatever to perform:

    * Secret Key Encryption (Like AES)
      (`Example <http://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/java/how-to-encrypt-and-decrypt-data-in-java-using-aes-algorithm.html>`_)

    * Asymmetric Key Encrypting

        * `Example Java RSA <http://www.mysamplecode.com/2011/08/rsa-encryption-decryption-using-bouncy.html>`_
          that uses `Bouncy Castle <https://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html>`_.

    * Hash function (`Hash example <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3103652/hash-string-via-sha-256-in-java>`_)

* Show me working examples.

E-Mail
^^^^^^

(Easy)

* Write code to send e-mail. You can use libraries.
* Demonstrate that the code works, and e-mail me the code.
* Please don't mail-bomb people.

Web Scrape
^^^^^^^^^^

(Medium)

* Use a library to automatically grab a web page
* Write code that parses that web page (or use a library to do it), and grab
  info from the page automatically.

Web Server
^^^^^^^^^^

(Medium)

Write a very simple web server. Serve up files over port 80. Respond to GET
requests. Write this yourself. You can look at examples, but don't just copy
one.

Don't use a class that does everything for you. Like the ``SimpleHttpServer``
class that exists in Python.

Write it in steps. Pick your favorite language to do it in.

* Write a program to listen on port 80. Try connecting to it with your web browser.
* Adjust your program so that it reads what the web browser sends. When you get two
  line feeds in a row, then it should be done sending data. At the very least, you'll need to read up to the first line feed. Print out what you read in.
* To do this properly, you should **not** assume the entire request comes in one data
  packet. Each character might come in its own packet. You'll should loop and build
  your buffer as the characters arrive. And you should even support a backspace
  character modifying the buffer.
  But for simplicity of coding I don't care if you make the assumption it does come in
  one packet and ignore the backspace thing.
* Send back a simple hard-coded response. See that the web browser gets it.
* Instead of a hard-coded response, pull a file.
* Remember that your response will be in two parts. The HTTP "head" section,
  and the actual HTTP document. See the
  `HTTP documentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol>`_.
  You'll likely need the ``Content-Length`` field as part of the head.
  This should be the number of bytes in the HTML portion of the document. Without
  this, the document will "hang" because the web client won't know when your
  document is done.
  bytes in your HTML document. T

Note, just following the points above will make your program vulnerable to a
"directory traversal" vulnerability. That's where a person asks for a file like:
``../etc/passwd`` or ``%2e%2e%2fetc%2f``. (The ``%2e`` is a URL encoded ``.``,
and ``%2f`` is a ``/``, in case you don't know.)

Single Sign On
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(Medium)

Implement `Amazon's login service <http://login.amazon.com/>`_ yourself.
Do it on the Web, Android, or iOS.

http://login.amazon.com/

To get credit for this, you'll need to show and explain the code in operation.

See me if you'd like to do single sign on with Facebook, GitHub, or some other
service instead.

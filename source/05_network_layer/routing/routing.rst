Routing Tutorial
================

Goal
----

The goal of this lab is to get you to "peek" inside the world of configurable
network switches and routers. We won't actually *do* much aside from
opening the door and peeking inside. But my hope is that if
you realize what you *can* do, you will:

* Learn more about it yourself.
* Have a better idea of what network engineers do, when you work with them.

I don't want network setup to be some puffy cloud that you think only wizards try.

If you want to get into networking as a career, it isn't hard.
You can buy old switches and routers off EBay for cheap.
The switches we will use here I bought for $20 or so.
There are a lot of documentation, manuals, and certification study guides
available on-line and in bookstores.

Cisco_ is a company is responsible for most of the routers on the Internet.
Hewlett-Packard also has many devices available.

Two-year schools are good places to learn the specific technical skills around
working with these devices if you are interested.
If
you search up "DMACC" and "Cisco" you can find some of the courses DMACC offers
to become certified working with Cisco Routers.

Switch Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The simplest switches are plug-and-play. You can buy them
at Wal-Mart. Sometimes switches are combined with routers
as an all-in-one device.

More complex switches can be configured. You can take a
24 port switch and configure it into four six-port switches
for example.

We are going to use a more complex switch than a Wal-Mart
one. This tutorial covers a very basic setup of this switch.


Install Telnet
--------------

We have already used Secure Shell (`SSH`_) to connect to another computer.
SSH is encrypted and a great way to communicate with computers remotely.

Before there was SSH, there was Telnet_. Telnet is like SSH, except it
isn't encrypted. If you log in with your user name and password, someone
with Wireshark that was on the network could see each of the letters
typed. Grabbing the password is easy.

You should never use Telnet.

That said, our switches don't support SSH, so we'll need to use Telnet.

Our Raspberry Pi does not include a Telnet program as part of its
default software. Because no one in their right mind would use it.
Since we aren't in our right mind, let's install telnet.

::

  # Get the update lists of software
  sudo apt-get update
  # Find telnet and install it
  sudo apt-get install telnet

Connect with a Serial Connection
--------------------------------

Great! We can connect with a telnet, right? No. Our switch doesn't
even have an IP address to telnet to.

We need to connect via a serial cable. Before there was telnet,
there was a serial connector. Most computers came with a type
of connector called `RS-232`_. We'd use this connector to connect our
modems.

A lot of networking equipment uses RS-232 as a way to first get
connected. Unfortunately computers don't come with RS-232 connectors
anymore. You can get an adapter that plugs into your USB connector that
will drive an RS-232 port. We'll need that.

We will also *may* need to download a driver for it, if it doesn't plug-and-play
like we hope:

Download driver:

* USA-19HS: https://www.tripplite.com/support/model/mid/USA-19HS
* Cable Matters (blue and silver): http://www.cablematters.com/cs-Downloads.aspx

MobaXTerm can connect to a "serial" line. Serial ports will be named
something like COM0, COM1, COM2, etc. Set your baud rate to 9600.



Find the Manual
---------------

We are using a Hewlett Packard HPJ9085a switch. We will probably need
a manual to learn how to use it. You might think that you can get the manual
on line by searching for "hpj9085a manual."

Or not. Unfortunately it is very difficult to find because of spam and bad
links. Go to HP and find the manual via a serial number lookup.

I searched on "hp manual lookup" and found `this page <http://h20180.www2.hp.com/apps/Lookup?h_pagetype=s-003&h_lang=en&h_client=z-a-r1002-3&h_page=index&h_cc=us&jumpid=hpr_R1002_USEN>`_.
Then I typed in "hpj9085a". That didn't work. Then I entered the serial number
and that *did* work.

I found in the manual on page 4-12 shows you how to reset switch so we can start fresh.
Give that a try.

Plug in the serial line. On startup, you will see::

	Waiting for Speed Sense.  Press <Enter> twice to continue.


Hit enter a few times. After a few more data screens, you get a
prompt that looks like:

.. code::

  ProCurve Switch 2610-24#

Type ``help`` to see a list of commands.

We want to use the ``setup`` command to set it up.
  * It will ask for a name. Call it 'CMSC 340 Switch 1' or similar.
  * Leave contact info, password blank.
  * We won't use a gateway yet. (TODO: Explain what we'd do for a gateway)
  * Spanning Tree - No if we know things will be hooked up right. Yes
    if we might have loops. (TODO: Possible exercise: Turn if off, hook
    up a loop to see what happens. Turn it on and see what happens.)
  * Skip time server setup. (TODO: Talk about time servers.)
  * IP. We will manually set. Hit spacebar twice Use 192.168.1.10
    (0 is broadcast, 1 is router.)
  * Netmask: 255.255.255.0

Connect to Switch with Telnet
-----------------------------

At this point, can use telnet.
	* Plug in Raspberry Pi to switch
	* Do ifconfig, won't have IP address. No magic yet.
	* Set ip: ``sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0``
	* Set gateway: ``sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1``
	* Type ``telnet 192.168.1.10``
	* Yay! We are there

There is also a browser interface.
  * Open browser and go to 192.168.1.10
  * Oooh, requires a java plugin. Whatever. We'll use the command line

Resetting the router
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From `NetworkWorld <http://www.networkworld.com/article/2343961/cisco-subnet/cisco-subnet-how-to-reset-a-cisco-router-to-factory-default-removing-the-startup-configuration-file.html>`_:

Type `` erase nvram`` followed by ``reload``.

Enter a secret 'cmsc340secret' - Enables configuration
Enter a password 'cmsc340password' - Enables monitoring
Enter virtual terminal password - 'cmsc340vt' for hooking up via network

Now type:
``help``

Then type:

``?``

then type:

``show ?``

To be able to do make configuration changes,
let's get into a higher mode. Type::

  enable

Then use our password ``cmsc340enable``.

You should have a # for a prompt to show privilege elevation.

Now type ``show ?`` and see all the cool new commands that we have.

Type ``show version`` See ROM, uptime, etc.

Type ``show interface`` See interface details.

Wait! I see that the ``line protocol is down``. Let's fix that.

Plug into 0/0 plug into switch. You should see messages on the
See if it gives you messages.

Type ``show interface`` to see ``line protocol is up``

We want to set up the other interface.
Type ``configure`` and get::

	cmsc340router#configure
	Configuring from terminal, memory, or network [terminal]? t
	Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.

Now we want to select our second card::

	cmsc340router(config)#interface FastEthernet0/1

See the commands available::

	cmsc340router(config-if)#?
	Interface configuration commands:
	[etc]

I did a Google search and found the syntax for the command
to set the IP address here:

http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/12_2/ip/configuration/guide/fipr_c/1cfipadr.html#wp1000918

Most computers give you a "Syntax error" when you type something wrong.
Cisco routers assume you typed in a machine name, and tries to telnet
to it. Along with a really long pause while it tries.

Now to set the IP of that second card::

	cmsc340router(config-if)#ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0

Turn on routing. This is supposed to be on by default, but that didn't happen for me::

	cmsc340router(config-if)#ip routing

Make the card 'active'::

    cmsc340router(config-if)#no shut

Exit::

	cmsc340router(config-if)#exit
	cmsc340router(config)#exit
	cmsc340router#

Now type ``show interface`` and see our second card is configured.



Save Changes
------------
After you are done, you need to save your changes::

	cmsc340router#copy running config
	Destination filename [config]? cmsc340
	%Warning:There is a file already existing with this name
	Do you want to over write? [confirm]

	872 bytes copied in 1.204 secs (724 bytes/sec)
	cmsc340router#

Port Based VLAN
---------------

Telnet to switch. (Not the router)

Type ``show vlan``. No VLAN yet.

Get into configuration mode with ``config``.

Create a new vlan with ``vlan 13``. Or whatever number. Prompt changes to let
you know what VLAN you are configuring.

Assign ports 1-5 to VLAN 13. ``untagged 1-5``. We won't really tag the
outgoing packets. We will just do it internally. This says 'no tags.'

Type ``exit`` to get out of VLAN 13 config. Type ``exit`` to get out VLAN
config. Type ``show vlan`` and see our new vlan. Type ``show running`` (``sh
ru`` for short) to see the details. Including what ports are part of the VLAN.
